# BASH and LINUX common problem notes and answers

Description of what I did to install and use Linux, and [various commands](bash-notes.md) or my [notes on git](git.md). I will handle the new files, in particular [installing debian](30-things-after-installing-debian-gnome.md) or [manjaro xfce](30-things-after-installing-manjaro-XFCE) or [multi-boot](multi-boot_5_linux_distros.md) numerous distros on a single laptop; the solutions of some more general problems found here and there are handled [here](general-problems.md), that's good to be remembered.

I added a [license](LICENSE), but it shouldn't be needed, as these are things found online just written down in a single place to hold them together.

Now there is a cheatsheet for [spreadsheets](spreadsheet-notes.md), and some experience with [terminal history](outputs-terminal.md) with the first installation of debian.
